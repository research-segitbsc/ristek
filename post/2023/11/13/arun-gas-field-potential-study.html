        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            One solution in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is to use a carbon capture and storage (CCS) system. 
            The CCS system consists of the process of injecting CO2 into geological storage below the surface and then 
            stabilizing the gas after injection to prevent leaking (Putriyana et al., 2023). Geological storage objects that 
            are suitable for CCS systems can be hydrocarbon reservoirs, coal bed methane, or saline aquifers. In Indonesia 
            itself, the implementation of the CCS system first started at the Gundih Gas Field Pilot Project 
            (Putriyana et al., 2023).
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the sites that has the potential to be developed as a geothermal system is the Arun Gas Field which is 
            located in Aceh Province, North Sumatra. This gas field is approximately 4.8 km wide, 16 km long and 10,000 ft 
            deep (Zhang & Lau, 2022). The reservoir in the Arun Gas Field has a relatively high temperature, namely around 
            178Â°C at a depth of around 10,050 ft (Pathak et al., 2004). Therefore, there is quite large potential for 
            geothermal resources in this gas field. Apart from that, there are also natural gas condensate reserves and quite
            large CO2 storage potential.

        <h3>Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Zhang & Lau's study (2022) models the reservoir geology of the Arun Gas Field and simulates reservoir models to 
            assess the potential for enhanced gas recovery by CO2 (CO2-EGR), CO2 storage, and geothermal extraction from the 
            reservoir. This simulation was carried out by dividing the site area into a grid consisting of four production 
            clusters with 118 wells. Further simulations were then carried out taking into account reservoir parameters such 
            as horizontal and vertical permeability and model layers. In this model, three case simulations were carried out 
            consisting of gas reinjection, CO2-EGR, geothermal extraction and CO2 storage phases.
        </p>
        <h3>Results and Discussions</h3>
        <p>
            The simulation results for these three cases show the potential for electrical energy produced from heat 
            extraction of up to 2.02 x 1011 kWh, potential CO2 storage of 1.20 Gt, and gas condensate production of up to 
            52.73 MMbbl. Furthermore, Zhang & Lau's (2022) study concluded that to utilize the geothermal extraction potential
            of 2.02 x 1011 kWh in 50 years, a 450 MW geothermal power plant could be used for the Arun Gas Field. By 
            calculating the Net Present Value (NPV) which consists of calculating the fixed and variable costs of operating 
            this gas field, the economic impact of the Arun Gas Field can be determined at $1.74 x 1010 which can be obtained
            at the end of the project in 2107.
        </p>
        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>
            Geothermal energy has great potential in Indonesia as one of the countries located on the Pacific Ring of Fire. 
            With more than 130 active volcanoes, Indonesia has a wealth of geothermal resources that can be utilized 
            sustainably. Utilizing geothermal energy not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions, but also provides social and 
            economic benefits, such as creating jobs, increasing access to electricity in remote areas, and reducing energy 
            costs for industry and households.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining geoscientific knowledge, wise public policy, and technological innovation, we can create a world 
            where natural resources are used intelligently, without damaging the environment, and maintaining the balance of 
            the earth's ecosystem for generations to come. In an effort to overcome the challenge of greenhouse gas emissions 
            and achieve the net zero emission (NZE) target by 2050, a CCS system combined with a geothermal system can be the 
            right solution.
